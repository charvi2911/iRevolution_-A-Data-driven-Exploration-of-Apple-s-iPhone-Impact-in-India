Project Brainstorming: iRevolution
1. The Problem: > Indian tech consumers face "Information Overload." With multiple iPhone models (13, 14, 15, 16) and fluctuating prices across Amazon, Flipkart, and offline stores, buyers struggle to identify the "Value-for-Money" sweet spot.

2. The Goal: > To create an interactive analytics dashboard that visualizes historical price trends against hardware specifications.

3. Solution Ideation:

Idea A: A simple price list (Rejected: Too static).

Idea B: A comparison engine (Rejected: Too common).

Idea C (Selected): A Data-Driven Storytelling Dashboard using Tableau and Flask that tracks Apple's "Premiumization" strategy from 2006 to 2022.

We have selected idea C as it gives a clear understanding at a glance.
